title: "When everything is HCI: A Queer Turn for Human-Computer Interaction"
author: Yi-Tong Chen
publishedAt: "2025-07-12"
summary: "HCI often positions itself as the “soft” alternative to engineering’s hard-tech focus, a stance Ann Light likens to women cast as “the Other.” New phenomenological methods can still entrench power if they ignore politics. Light urges a Queer Theory turn: reject binaries, embrace experimental, disruptive practices, and define HCI on its own terms. As human–machine boundaries blur, a queer HCI framework lets anything count as HCI—as long as it keeps critically re-imagining technology–society relations."

In our society, there's no need to justify technological advancement. We
*always* want to be faster, stronger, and better — it's a human impulse.
Against this "hard" driving force of technology, HCI emerges as a
movement — an alternative focus within computer science — that advocates the
"soft" considerations of human factors in the development of computer
systems.

In the process of establishing itself as an academic field, HCI researchers have explored
a range of epistemologies and methodologies. From its ergonomic origins
to the positivist practices rooted in behavioral science, HCI has
attempted to define its "essence" by interacting with, or positioning
itself against, existing knowledge in computer science, engineering,
psychology, and other disciplines.

## HCI as "The Other": The Feminist Analogy

Ann Light (2010, 2011) compares the position of HCI within computer science
to that of women within society. Citing Simone de Beauvoir's *The Second
Sex* (1949), she argues that while HCI is oppositional — even militant — toward
mainstream industry practices that care too little about users, it faces
a problem similar to the feminist movement in the 80's: by too
often positioning itself against the Other (men/engineering), it risks being
defined *in relation to* that Other. Eventually, this results in a
normative narrative where "he is the absolute, she *is* the Other."

In recent years, phenomenological approaches have become prevalent in
HCI research, aiming for a richer, "thicker" understanding of the person
and society embedded in technology — much like the turn to *lived
experience* in feminist research. Although such methods enable us to
unearth more embodied, situated truths about human-computer
relationships, without a critical lens they can fail to address power
dynamics and oppression (as in much phenomenological UX research
conducted for commercial interests). Worse, they can reaffirm and
reinforce the existing status quo as accepted "truth."

> "There remains the danger, though, that if we bring in diverse social
> aspects but ignore overtly political relations, we embed our practices
> further in the service of the commercial technology industry of the
> present, using our skills and our understanding of embodied and
> situated experience to help produce more effective and efficient
> machines and perpetuate the social status quo, not find a more
> effective context for life." (Light, 2010)

Light suggests that, just as feminism in the 80s benefited from a turn
to queer perspectives, HCI would likewise benefit. Rather than
attending to dualities — socio-techno,
tradition-development — through oppositional positioning, HCI should
adopt Queer Theory as a model, defining itself against no one, and not
needing a *One* to respond to. In other words, HCI could *perform* itself in its own terms.

## The Queer Turn of HCI

Instead of acting as a counter-force to technological advancement that
*knows better* than "those engineers and merchants eyeing only
efficiency and profit," HCI should be comfortable with experimental,
radical, and critical acts that create chaos and disorientation in
people's understandings of HCI, technology, society, and the world as a
whole.

Responding to Light and other pioneers' call, HCI researchers since the
2010s have begun, to varying degrees and from multiple angles, to
incorporate traces of Queer Theory into their work. See [^3] for a
literature review of such projects.

Freed from any essentialist characteristics defined in relation to the
Other, anything *can be* HCI. This perspective is especially valuable
today, as human-machine and socio-techno boundaries continue to blur
with the democratization of ubiquitous computing and artificial
intelligence. If, one day, there were no longer an *inorganic*
"computer" distinct from an *organic* "human," queer HCI research could
be livelier than ever, as it continues questioning, disrupting, and
reconsidering a world in which everything *is* HCI.
